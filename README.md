# Flag_Points
Flag Points!

This is the bash script I utilized to gain 100 contributions for win a flag for our class.

Some conditions that must be met are:

git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
//this will allow the script to run without pasuing for a username and password
//verify you git install is functioning correctly

git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
//self explanatory

git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
//required to be set as a contributor's e-mail or else contirbutions will not increment

Enjoy the extra points!
